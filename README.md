- 👋 Hello, I’m Jonathan Joonho Oh

- 🎓 I'm a first-year with junior standing pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at Emory University. I entered Emory with 65 college credits amassed during my dual-enrollment years from 7th-12th Grade.

- 👨🏻‍💻 I plan to pursue a M.S. in CS at Princeton University along with an MBA at Harvard University.

- 🤖 This past summer after graduating high school, I was hired as a software engineering intern at Johnson & Johnson MedTech. I worked In Ethicon Endo-Surgery's Research and Development Lab, where I developed multiple Python scripts to autonomously test a surgical robotic arms transient response to a step input, along with multiple surgical operations such as cutting and stapling. I also developed broadband tests for tuning the Independent Stack Manipulator's tool drive motors for the operation and testing of surgical robotic arms. I also had the opportunity to expand my skillset in the Data Science team. Here, I learned Git version control and developed an optimized data type validation algorithms utilizing the Pandas data frame which sped up data visualization time by up to 60.86%.
